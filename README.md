# Rubik-Cube-Solver
Highlighted Line:
Built a digital Rubik’s Cube in C++ and created three different ways to show and solve it using basic C++ tools.

Description:

Used three unique class designs to shape the cube, each using simple C++ structures like arrays and lists.

Added three search methods—BFS, DFS, and IDDFS—to solve the cube when mixed up to 8 times, all under 3 seconds.

Put in Korf’s IDA* method, which can untangle a cube scrambled 13 times in less than 10 seconds.

Focused on making the code neat, easy to change, and quick to run.

The project shows skill in problem-solving, creative thinking, and smart use of C++.
